                <p class="text">React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using
                    React
                    and the app platform’s native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your
                    platform’s
                    APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React components:
                    <span class="sans-italic"> bundles of reusable, nestable code.</span> You can learn more about React
                    in the next section. But first, let’s cover how components work in React Native.

                <p class="text">React Native runs on <span class="underline">React</span>, a popular open source library
                    for building user interfaces
                    with JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section
                    can get you started or can serve as a refresher course.</p>

                <p>We’re going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>

                <p class="text"> <span class="weight">+ components.</span> The rest of this introduction to React uses
                    cats in its examples: friendly, approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.</p>

                <p class="text"> <span class="weight">+ JSX.</span> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that
                    lets you write elements inside JavaScript like so: <span class="tags"> &lt Text &gt Hello, I am your
                        cat!
                        &lt/Text&gt</span>.</p>

                <p class="text">The React docs have <span class="underline">a comprehensive guide to JSX</span> you can
                    refer to
                    learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use variables inside it.
                    Here you are declaring a <span class="tags"> name </span> for the cat,name, and embedding it
                    with curly braces inside <span class="tags">&lt Text &gt </span></p>

                <p><span class="weight">+ props.</span> Props is short for “properties”. </p>

                <p class="text"><span class="weight">+ state.</span> While you can think of props as arguments you use
                    to configure
                    how components render, state is like a component’s personal data storage.
                    State is useful for handling data that changes over time or that comes from user interaction.
                    State gives your components memory!</p>

                <h2 class="begin">Handling text input <span class="chapter">Chapter 4</span></h2>
                <p class="text">TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text.
                    It has an <span class="sans-italic"> onChangeText</span> prop that takes a function to be called
                    every
                    time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function
                    to be called when the text is submitted.</p>
                <p class="text">For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their
                    words into a different language. In this new language, every single word is written
                    the same way: <img src="images/pizza.png" alt="pizza">. So the sentence
                    "Hello there Bob" would be translated as
                    "<img src="images/pizza.png" alt="pizza"><img src="images/pizza.png" alt="pizza">".</p>
